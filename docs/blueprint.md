# **App Name**: FocusFlow

## Core Features:

- Application Whitelist: App selection: the user selects which applications will be allowed to be used when Focus Mode is activated.
- Focus Mode Activation: Focus mode toggle: a switch to start/stop the focus mode. While in focus mode, only the selected apps can be used.
- System Override: System app safeguard: The focus mode will never affect system apps, which will be allowed to operate independently (settings, phone, camera, microphone).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) for focus and concentration.
- Background color: Light Gray (#ECEFF1) to reduce eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#B39DDB) for highlights and active states.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clean readability and a modern feel.
- Simple, outlined icons representing each whitelisted application.
- Clean and straightforward layout with a clear list of selectable applications.
- Smooth transition animations when toggling focus mode.
